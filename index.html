          <dfn>HTML</dfn> allows a user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications. HTML is not a programming language, meaning it doesn't have the ability to create dynamic functionality. Using html requires some rules as the other markup languages do in order to ensure that your work is high-quality but it is not as complicated as them. So if you want to get high quality of your work, you have to follow its rules.

          About me
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am Prisca Marie Roseline, who is from Madagascar. And I’m a 22-year-old woman, who studies developing at onja. It is a project that teaches young people, who can’t afford their study anymore. I’ve been learning programming for 2 months and I want to share my knowledge with people who begin to study like me. Coding is such an enjoyable course because it is mostly practical. So, you surely get more experiences while you are learning. As, I have just started studying, I have some difficulties in understanding our lesson sometimes, but it is generally fine.
